The fac_crop.ipynb is the basic code for one image and is workign fine though requires like 1-2 minutes to process one image<br>
the itercrop is where I have put it in a loop and doing it for all the frames of a video. It does not throw any error but there are two issues:<br>
1) The cropped file is not being stored where it should be<br>
2) Taking too long to process
